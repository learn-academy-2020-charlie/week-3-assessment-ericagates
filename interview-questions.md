# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destrucuring is the act of simplifying variable names by setting them to this.state where they are originally initialized.

  Researched answer: The object destructuring is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. What's better, object destructuring can extract multiple properties in one statement, can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn't exist. (https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-object-destructuring/#:~:text=The%20object%20destructuring%20is%20a,the%20property%20doesn't%20exist.)



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is any event that changes the DOM or the screen where the web page is rendered. For example could be a click or a user entr that changes the pages.

  Researched answer: DOM (Document Object Model) events are actions that occurs as a result of the user action or as result of state change of the elements of a DOM tree. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events)



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A Class is the blue print for an object that contains standardized behaviors and characteristics. An object is a specific instance of a class. 

  Researched answer: A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/HLUs/User_Guide/classes/classoview.shtml




4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: HTML div is a division that has a defined opening and closing with as many items inside, but a span is just one line that wraps a small portion of text.

  Researched answer: 


5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: React.Fragment is a division in a react component that wraps up multiple elements and is necessary to use because react components can only have one return.

  Researched answer: Both the tags (<div> and <span>) are used to represent the part of the webpgage, <div> tag is used a as block part of the webpage and <span> tag is used as a inline part of the webpage (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-div-and-span-tag-in-html/)



6. What are three options for creating responsive design? 
  
  Your answer: Responsive designs can be created using Flexbos with CSS, CSS Media quereies with CSS, and with HTML using the meta tag


  Researched answer: Responsive website design consists of the following three main components:

Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes. (https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/responsive-website.html)



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.

In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects. https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html)

- irb
Its name is short for “Interactive Ruby Shell”, and yes, it is another kind of shell: Just like the shell running in your terminal irb is also a program that interactively waits for you to type something, and hit enter. However, since this is a Ruby shell, it will expect that you type Ruby code instead of system commands. (http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/your_tools/irb.html)

- Instance variable
In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.[1] An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class. Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable)

- Ruby
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))

- Class relationships
Class relationships define how various classes and kinds of classes are related to each other. For example, there is a special relationship between a class called Flower and a class called Rose: A Rose is a type of Flower. There is a different kind of relationship between the classes Student, Course and Textbook. A Student uses a Textbook; a Course has a Textbook. Defining these relationships help us understand how objects in a program work together and communicate with each other.(http://www-acad.sheridanc.on.ca/~jollymor/prog24178/oop6.html)

- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby
These methods allow us to access a class’s instance variable from outside the class. Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
